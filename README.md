## This is a huge work in progress so expect sloppy code and bugs

*that being said, this is just a 2D side-scroller game that I'm working on for fun and the sake of learning*


# Controls
- `A` - move left
- `D` - move right
- `W` - jump
  
- `Right Click` - place block
- `left Click` - break block

## I think that's everything for now. :)
